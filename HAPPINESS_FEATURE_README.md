# Happiness Image Feature Implementation

## Overview

This implementation adds the ability for adopters to upload "happiness images" showing how happy their adopted pets are in their new homes. These images will be visible to other users to showcase successful adoptions.

## Features Added

### 1. Database Schema

- Added `happiness_image` field to the `adoption` table
- Migration file: `supabase/migrations/20241003_add_adoption_happiness_image.sql`

### 2. API Endpoints

- **Upload Endpoint**: `/api/v1/adoption/happiness-image/upload` - For uploading happiness images
- **Update Endpoint**: `/api/v1/adoption/[id]/happiness-image` - For associating uploaded images with adoptions
- Updated pet endpoints to include happiness images in responses

### 3. Components

- **HappinessImageUpload**: Component for uploading happiness images (only for adopters of approved adoptions)
- **HappinessImageDisplay**: Component for displaying happiness images with click-to-expand functionality

### 4. Security & Authorization

- Only the adopter can upload happiness images for their own adoptions
- Only works for approved (completed) adoptions
- User authentication is required via x-user-id header

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Run Database Migration

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /Users/kathjordan/Development/projects/paws-connect

# Run the migration (adjust command based on your Supabase setup)
supabase db push
# OR if using direct SQL:
# psql your_database_url < supabase/migrations/20241003_add_adoption_happiness_image.sql
```

### 2. Test the Feature

1. **Approve an adoption** (if you don't have any approved adoptions):
   - Go to `/adoptions` in your admin panel
   - Find a pending adoption and approve it

2. **Test happiness image upload**:
   - Go to the specific adoption details page `/adoptions/[id]`
   - If you're logged in as the adopter, you should see the "Happiness Gallery" section
   - Upload an image showing the happy pet

3. **View happiness images**:
   - Happiness images will appear as small overlays on pet avatars in:
     - Pet management table
     - Adoptions list
     - Pet listings (where applicable)

## File Changes Made

### New Files:

- `supabase/migrations/20241003_add_adoption_happiness_image.sql`
- `src/app/api/v1/adoption/happiness-image/upload/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/v1/adoption/[id]/happiness-image/route.ts`
- `src/components/HappinessImageUpload.tsx`
- `src/components/HappinessImageDisplay.tsx`

### Modified Files:

- `database.types.ts` - Added happiness_image field to adoption table types
- `src/config/types/pet.ts` - Added adoption and happiness image fields
- `src/app/(pages)/(admin)/adoptions/[id]/page.tsx` - Added happiness upload component
- `src/app/(pages)/(admin)/adoptions/page.tsx` - Added happiness image display in list
- `src/components/PetTable.tsx` - Added happiness image display
- Pet API endpoints - Updated to include happiness images in responses

## Usage

### For Adopters:

1. Once your adoption is approved, visit the adoption details page
2. You'll see a "Happiness Gallery" section
3. Upload a photo showing your happy pet
4. The image will be visible to others as proof of a successful adoption

### For Administrators:

- Happiness images appear as small heart-themed overlays on pet photos
- Adopted pets with happiness images show "âœ¨ Happy & Loved" indicators
- Click on happiness images to view them in full size

## Technical Notes

### Authentication

- Uses the existing `useAuth` context for user identification
- Passes user ID via `x-user-id` header to API endpoints
- Only adopters can upload images for their own adoptions

### Image Storage

- Images are stored in Supabase Storage under `adoption-happiness/` folder
- URLs are stored in the database for quick access
- Images are validated for type and size (10MB limit)

### Performance

- Happiness images are lazy-loaded and only shown when available
- Small overlay images don't impact page performance
- Full-size viewing is done via modal to avoid page navigation

## Future Enhancements

- Add ability to upload multiple happiness images
- Add adoption story text alongside images
- Create a dedicated "Success Stories" page
- Add notification system when happiness images are uploaded
- Add image moderation/approval system
