# Weekly Top Donors API

Returns the top donors for the past 7 days, excluding anonymous donations and users without an ID. Results are grouped by donor and sorted by total amount (fixed) with a maximum of 10 users.

- Method: GET
- Path: `/api/v1/donations/weekly-top`

## Parameters

There are no query parameters. The API always:

- Uses the last 7 days (rolling window to current date)
- Sorts by total donated amount (ties broken by count then recency)
- Returns up to 10 donors
- Includes donations whether or not theyâ€™re linked to a fundraising campaign (fundraising can be null)
