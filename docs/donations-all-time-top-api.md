# All-Time Top Donors API

Returns the top donors across all time, excluding anonymous donations and users without an ID. Results are grouped by donor and sorted by total amount with a maximum of 10 users.

- Method: GET
- Path: `/api/v1/donations/top`

## Parameters

There are no query parameters. The API always:

- Aggregates all donations historically
- Sorts by total donated amount (ties broken by count then recency)
- Returns up to 10 donors
