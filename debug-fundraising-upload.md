# Fundraising Image Upload Issue Analysis

## Current Flow:

1. **User selects images** → `handleImageUpload` in FundraisingModal
2. **Images uploaded individually** → `/api/v1/fundraising/upload` endpoint
3. **URLs collected** → Added to `formData.images` array
4. **Form submitted** → `addCampaign` → `/api/v1/fundraising` POST
5. **Campaign created** → Should include `images` array in database

## Potential Issues:

### 1. Upload Endpoint Issues

- **Supabase Storage**: Bucket permissions, file size limits
- **File Path**: `fundraising/` folder permissions
- **Content-Type**: Image type validation

### 2. Frontend Logic Issues

- **Race Conditions**: Upload not completing before form submit
- **State Management**: URLs not properly added to formData
- **Error Handling**: Silent failures in upload process

### 3. Backend API Issues

- **Schema Validation**: Images array not properly validated
- **Database Insert**: Images field not being saved correctly

## Debugging Steps:

### Step 1: Check Upload Endpoint

- Add more detailed logging to `/upload/route.ts`
- Verify Supabase storage configuration
- Test file upload manually

### Step 2: Check Frontend State

- Add console logs to track image upload progress
- Verify formData.images is populated before submit
- Check for any async/await issues

### Step 3: Check Backend Processing

- Add logging to fundraising POST endpoint
- Verify images array is received and processed correctly
- Check database schema matches expected format

## Quick Test:

1. Create fundraising with images
2. Check browser network tab for upload responses
3. Check database for images field content
4. Verify Supabase storage for uploaded files
